This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Rede app for iPhone and any other device or platform.

## 1.0 Information collected

Rede does not collect information of any kind. All information available to the Rede developer is given by Apple through the Developer Portal. This information is anonymous statistics and is described in more detail under the Apple Privacy Policy.

## 1.1 Technical basics

### 1.2 Information usage

We use the information we collect to operate and improve our apps, and provide customer support. We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Rede’ functionality. We reserve the right to disclose any of your information we might possess in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property. In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## 2.0 Security

Currently we implement no security measures, because no user information is stored. If this changes in the future, this section will be updated to reflect that change.

## 3.0 Accessing, changing, or deleting information

You may access, change, or delete your data from the Rede iOS app. We do not store nor have access to a backup of your data.

## 4.0 Third-party links and content

Rede displays information and content from a third-party API. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we hold no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.

## 5.0 Information regarding privacy laws

### 5.1 California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

### 5.2 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or store information at our website from those we have verified to be under 13 years of age nor have we designed any part of our website to attract anyone under 13 years of age.

### 5.3 Information for European Union Customers

By using Rede, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your data outside of the European Union.

### 5.4 International Transfers of Information

Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## 6.0 Your Consent

By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.

## Contacting Us

If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email joao@zeroloop. Please note that for security reasons data deletion should be done within the Rede app, not via email requests – this is because we can not access your information

## Changes to this policy

If we decide or need to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so far:
