I am an iOS Developer, and part time addon developer for a litlte known game called World of Warcraft.

### Some skills and achievements I’m proud of:
- I’m well versed in UIKit and SwiftUI alike;
- I have integrated apps with CoreData and CloudKit;
- I have worked in over 10 apps in the last 3 years;
- I achieved KSM in 2 seasons of WoW so far;

What else do you need?

### My story

I’ve been developing iOS apps for the last 5 years. During this time I went from simple TableView apps that parced HTML, to apps that integrate complex databases and are used by thousands of people every day. Eck, I even see a huge poster for an App I developed for a client.

After teaching myself iOS App Development, I worked at an agency, and later for a company that does in-house development. All the while, I’ve also been doing some freelance gigs.

If you’re looking to build an awesome iOS app, let me know. I might be able to help ;)
