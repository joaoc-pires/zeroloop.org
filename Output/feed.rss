The first app in my sight is called redE - Comboios de Portugal.</p><p>This app allowed the users to check the time tables of trains in a given train station in <em>almost</em> real time.</p><h1>The API</h1><p>This library is in the core of the app’s functionality. It what allows to search for the train stations, get said stations time tables, and in the future will also allow to check the time table per train.</p><p>The API however is not documented at all. It’s open in the IP’s <a href="https://www.infraestruturasdeportugal.pt">website</a>, but there’s no documentation, and no assurance that it will keep working in the future - but we work with what we have.</p><h1>Architecture</h1><p>I tried to keep the library as simple as possible. There’s one main object that is exposed, <code></code><code>StationService</code><code></code> and it has both synchronous and asynchronous methods to get the relevant data. There either return a <code></code><code>Result.Type</code><code></code> or a model representing the API data.</p><p>The returned objects are all part of the <code></code><code>StationService</code><code></code> simply because I like the semantics of <code></code><code>StationSerice.Node</code><code></code> and <code></code><code>StationService.StationQueryReply</code><code></code>. They clearly indicate what it being returned to the user.</p><p>There’s not much (read nothing) in terms of HTTP headers that is required, as such, a simple <code></code><code>DataTask</code><code></code> is used throughout.</p><p>The full documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/joaoc-pires/PortugalTrains">here</a>.</p><p>The app, once (re-)released, can be found <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rede-comboios-de-portugal/id1447635458">here</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://zeroloop.org/posts/minimalist-to-a-fault</guid><title>From minimal to none…</title><description>From minimal to none…</description><link>https://zeroloop.org/posts/minimalist-to-a-fault</link><pubDate>Sat, 8 Jan 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>From minimal to none…</h1><p>I’ve been a fan of minimalism for years. Not only the aesthetics but also the life philosophy. At one point in my life I could fit everything I owned in a car - granted, I was only 20 at the time. I always try to avoid being extreme in anything I do, but if you’re thinking about something for too long, you might not be able to avoid it until it bite you in the ass.</p><p>At the end of August 2021 I got my second Covid-19 vaccine. I thought this was the perfect time to do a clean up, both in my home and digitally. People love symbolic events, I guess. I’ve thrown out or gave to friends and relatives lots of stuff I didn’t need and was basically hoarding - I had 3 graphics cards just in case the one I was using collapsed from all the OpenTTD I was playing - the Nvidia 30xx is still a new architecture, you never know!</p><h1>Digital Minimalism</h1><p>After reducing my unused graphics cards, monitors and mice to zero, it was time to look at my digital footprint. iOS has a feature that tells you that some of the passwords you have saved in Keychain are reused or compromised. I suspect using <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com">Have I Been Pwned</a> or some other similar service. And this has been bugging me for some time. I decided I’d change all passwords of services I care about to Keychain generated ones, and delete the accounts for services I don’t care. After doing just that, I also decided I’d add some extra security layer, by using Google Authenticator - spoiler alert, this will bite me in the ass in a couple of lines.</p><p>With the accounts taken cared, it was time to do the same to my devices. The first victim was my laptop. Clean wipe and reinstalled macOS. Felt good!</p><p>Then came the iPad, Watch and my iPhone.</p><h1>The Fallout</h1><p>At this point, all my devices were decluttered, my accounts were secure and all seemed good! Time to start cluttering again. First clone my GitHub repos that were super secure with the awesome sauce Google Authenticator. And even if they weren’t I had the keys GitHub gives me when I first added the authenticator - all was good!</p><p>Thing is, after installing the Google Authenticator app, none of my secrets were showing there - small panic!</p><p>After Googling a bit, I found that Google Authenticator does not backup to any service - BIG PANIC! I was an idiot, and should’ve checked this prior to doing anything. No problem, the only important accounts were my GitHub and my Degiro account. To GitHub I had saved the codes in Apple Notes, and to Degiro I knew I could just call them and remove the authenticator.</p><p>But there’s more. Apple is not great at web services. And “It Just Works” sometimes doesn’t. My notes were not synced across iCloud. I probably didn’t give it enough time to sync, or it may have found a problem. I don’t know what happened, just that for some reason, the GitHub notes I had saved with my codes were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Oh no!</p><p>Degiro was easy. After a 10 minute call I recovered my account - all goof in the hood. With Github, not so much. I opened a ticket with them, but I knew from the get go it was probably a lost cause. Three days later I got the response saying I couldn’t get the access - all was lost. Fuck...</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>I lost my GitHub account of several years. I had a couple of projects there, but only one active and private - Ares, my RSS Reader. I was (and still am) actively working on a side project and all the work was lost. Thankfully it wasn’t too much lost there. Right now the major loss is really just Ares. I can’t update it and will have to rewrite everything from scratch. Thankfully I’m probably the only person that uses it on a daily basis and it won’t affect that many people. My website, I managed to migrate to this one, and even grabbed a new domain, just to restart - <strong>I</strong> really love symbolic events.</p><p>Looking back, I don’t think it was GitHub’s or Apple’s or Google’s fault I lost my account. I should’ve done my due diligence. I failed to do that because I wanted to get a fresh start. Got it in more ways than I wanted. But lesson learned.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://zeroloop.org/posts/on-social-media</guid><title>My Troubled Relationship With Social Media</title><description>From minimal to none…</description><link>https://zeroloop.org/posts/on-social-media</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>My Troubled Relationship With Social Media</h1><p>When Social Media first started, in the early 2000’s, I was all over it. Being a tech geek, Myspace, Hi5 and, Orkut where all the rage for me at the time. Then came Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and for a brief moment Google+. They we’re more polished services, and attracted more people (maybe not Google+), but by the early 2010’s the shininess of Social Media was wearing off, for me.</p><h1>Facebook</h1><p>When Facebook first appeared all my friends were on Hi5. Today I can’t say why we liked it so much. Maybe it was the wow factor of being able to connect with all your friends at the same time? An asynchronous LAN party of sorts, where geeks and non-geeks alike could share their experiences? Maybe it was just Web 2.0 being discovered by the masses?</p><p>Whatever it was, it was contagious. All of the sudden not only my friends, but my family had a Facebook account. My technological illiterate mother was spending hours playing Farmville on Facebook.</p><p>By the early 2010’s Facebook had too much makeup, and it couldn’t hide it’s ugly features.</p><ul><li>Privacy settings changed place often enough that you could never tell where they actually where;</li><li>Whatever setting you changed, they were always ethereal, reverting to its default values, just often enough you would forget to check;</li><li>The constant imitation of other services features;</li></ul><p>Eventually, it became too much for me. I don’t remember exactly why, but the moment the EU “Right to be Forgotten” law was passed, I Googled “Delete Facebook account” and just did it. – Yes, I’m aware of the irony.</p><p>Ever since that day, I can only feel vindicated by that decision. The multiple data privacy scandals, and the most recent 500 000 000 users data leak, where no data of mine was present, gave me a sense of relief (and, if I’m being honest, smugness towards all my friends who still have Facebook accounts).</p><p>Today, for me, Facebook looks like the something a Bond Villain would come up with, to get all the world secrets and sell to the highest bidder. – Dramatic, I know</p><h1>Instagram</h1><p>There’s not much I can say about Instagram. I liked it, even when Bond Villain Co, bought it, I still enjoyed it. I knew the consequences of using it, while clamming Facebook was horrible – I was a hypocrite. But somewhere between the 30% posts being ads, the stories, and the algorithm feed, Instagram was no longer something I enjoyed. Along with Facebook it had to go. It was only last month, but in Instagram too, I deleted my account.</p><h1>Twitter</h1><p>I have a weird relationship with twitter. I don’t think I’m the only one either.</p><p>I’ve had multiple Twitter account throughout the years. Deleted not out of outrage or smugness, but because at times I didn’t see the appeal.</p><p>But somewhere along my sporadic use, it started to make sense to me.</p><p>Twitter, in my opinion, is a service that sells Parasocial Interactions. “Follow this famous person, and react to what they have to say. They’re found in the same place you find your friends, and sometimes they might even react to you. The famous are just like your friends.”</p><p>It’s a megaphone of hot takes and miscommunication. A place where ideas can’t be fully expressed nor understood.</p><p>Having reach this understanding of twitter, I can now use it to my benefit. I barely post, except to give some feedback to a developer or friend. I do follow some people outside of my IRL social group, but only to keep up with news or something noteworthy.</p><p>Everything old, is new again, Twitter to me became RSS, with extra steps and a social graph.</p><p>One of the main things I do not enjoy about twitter though, the algorithm timeline. I want to see the post of the people I follow, and I want to see them as they are posted, not how Twitter thinks I should see them.</p><p>Maybe I should integrate Twitter into Ares?</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://zeroloop.org/posts/ares-rss-reader</guid><title>Ares – RSS Reader</title><description>Today, after a few days of struggle with AppStore review, Ares, my most recent app was finally released</description><link>https://zeroloop.org/posts/ares-rss-reader</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Ares – RSS Reader</h1><p>I did Ares as a personal project. Last time I published an App in my own name to the AppStore was in 2019. I wasn’t happy with it then, and I sure wasn’t happy with it last month when I finally decided to remove it.</p><p>Throughout the years I’ve release 3 apps under my name before Ares. They were all small projects I did to keep myself occupied or to create a portfolio. This was incredibly useful when starting my career. But at this point I wanted something more professional, for lack of better word.</p><h1>Introducing, Ares – RSS Reader</h1><p>As is stands right now, Ares is a very complete 1st version. It supports import and export of OPML files, organization with drag-and-drop, saving items, offline reading mode, swipe gestures in SwiftUI (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650449">why I’m proud of it</a>), iCloud Sync, an Ad Banner and a yearly 2.49€ to remove adds.</p><p>During its TestFlight phase I had around 90 daily users – not sure how it will translate to actual downloads, though.</p><p>I’m already planning some new features for the app, first of which, localizing in Portuguese, Spanish and French.</p><p>All in all, I’m really proud of this 1st version!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
