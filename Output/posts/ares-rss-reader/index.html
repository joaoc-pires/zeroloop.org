Last time I published an App in my own name to the AppStore was in 2019. I wasn’t happy with it then, and I sure wasn’t happy with it last month when I finally decided to remove it.</p><p>Throughout the years I’ve release 3 apps under my name before Ares. They were all small projects I did to keep myself occupied or to create a portfolio. This was incredibly useful when starting my career. But at this point I wanted something more professional, for lack of better word.</p><h1>Introducing, Ares – RSS Reader</h1><p>As is stands right now, Ares is a very complete 1st version. It supports import and export of OPML files, organization with drag-and-drop, saving items, offline reading mode, swipe gestures in SwiftUI (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650449">why I’m proud of it</a>), iCloud Sync, an Ad Banner and a yearly 2.49€ to remove adds.</p><p>During its TestFlight phase I had around 90 daily users – not sure how it will translate to actual downloads, though.</p><p>I’m already planning some new features for the app, first of which, localizing in Portuguese, Spanish and French.</p><p>All in all, I’m really proud of this 1st version!</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/ares">ares</a></li><li><a href="/tags/app">app</a></li><li><a href="/tags/ios">ios</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
